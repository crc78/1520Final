      <div id="aboutParas">
	<p>&emsp;I was born and raised in Grove City, Pennsylvania. Going through school, I was always interested in science, music, and art. I'm 6 ft tall and always get asked if I played sports but nope, I wasn't interested. I was one of those kids who lived for theater and both marching and concert band.</p>

	<p>&emsp;Funny enough, I had no clue about programming coming into college. Unless you consider learning HTML back when I played Neopets as a kid religously. My highschool had ZERO computer classes and I lacked initiative to teach it to myself. But I always wanted to do something in the STEM field and had a deep interest in computers so I decided that's what I want to do with my life. I took a pretty big leap of faith but it ended up being the best decision of my life. I love computer engineering and in some ways, I can't wait to graduate, get out in the real world, and continue learning anything I can about the field.</p>

	<p>&emsp;As for current interests, I knit a lot. I miss my cats and my dog a lot. I watch too much Game Grumps. I read when I have the time, shout out to Dave Eggers my favorite author. And to show I don't just sit around all day, I am an avid but amateur bike rider. Riding around through Pittsburgh's different neighborhoods is great, let me tell you.</p>
